            <p>This isn’t just the story of a car company.</p>
            <p>It’s the beginning of a movement—one that believes true luxury should be clean, quiet, and conscious. Njorden Automotive was born from the Nordic landscape and the myth of Njord, god of wind, sea, and wealth. Our mission is to craft vehicles that honor that spirit: effortless movement, natural harmony, and timeless elegance.</p>
            <p>We’re building a new kind of car—one that speaks softly but carries deep meaning. Hydrogen-powered. Analogue in soul. Designed for those who want more than status—they want stillness.</p>
            <h2>Where We Are Now</h2>
            <p>We’re at the beginning. Our design language is forming. Materials are being sourced. Concepts are in motion. The first prototypes are ahead.</p>
            <h2>What You Can Expect</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Journal entries documenting each phase of creation</li>
                <li>Exclusive concept art and behind-the-scenes design thinking</li>
                <li>Invitations to early viewings, virtual walkthroughs, or founder Q&amp;As</li>
                <li>A place to witness not just what we’re building—but why</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Be Part of It</h2>
            <p>Njorden isn’t built in a vacuum. It’s shaped by those who believe in elegance with integrity. Join us—not just as a follower, but as part of a future that flows.</p>
