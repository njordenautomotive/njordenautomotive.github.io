    <h2>Beauty Isn’t Enough. It Has to Mean Something.</h2>
    <p>You’ve seen sleek cars before. But what about one that feels like it belongs to both the earth and the future? You want more than horsepower—you want harmony. Most “green” cars feel cold, sterile, and over-designed. Luxury is lost in the tech. The story gets lost in the stats.</p>
    <p>And if it doesn’t feel like you? It’s not worth it.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>The Future Drives Different</h2>
    <p>Njorden is not just another car brand. It’s a philosophy on wheels.</p>
    <p>Named after Njord—the Norse god of wind, sea, and wealth—our brand carries the spirit of powerful movement guided by calm purpose. Born from Nordic heritage and driven by hydrogen power, we’ve designed vehicles that speak softly, live lightly, and carry the weight of legacy.</p>
    <p>Inside, it’s analogue—on purpose. Crafted interiors using reclaimed wood, wool, and metal remind you that elegance doesn’t expire.</p>
    <p>No noise. No emissions. No compromise.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="benefits">
    <div>
      <h3>Drive Without a Trace</h3>
      <p>Zero-emission hydrogen propulsion means your journeys don’t leave anything behind—not even guilt.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Luxury That Breathes</h3>
      <p>Reused Scandinavian materials, hand-finished with timeless craftsmanship. No plastic flash. Just calm, quiet elegance.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Technology That Respects You</h3>
      <p>Minimalist, analogue-inspired interface. Everything you need, nothing you don’t. The focus is you and the road.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

    <h2>You’re Not Alone in Wanting Something Better</h2>

  <section class="faq">
    <div>
      <h3>Is this a real car I can buy today?</h3>
      <p>Not yet. Njorden is an emerging brand, preparing the foundation for vehicles that will redefine clean luxury mobility.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Why hydrogen, not electric?</h3>
      <p>Because real sustainability looks ahead. Hydrogen allows for fast refueling, long range, and zero emissions—without rare earth extraction or heavy batteries.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Where are your cars made?</h3>
      <p>Design begins in Norway. Every build will follow our sustainability-first philosophy—locally sourced, globally responsible.</p>
